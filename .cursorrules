Project Rules

Tech Stack

Use Next.js 14 with the App Router (app/ directory).

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use TypeScript for all code.

Use Lucide React for icons.

Use shadcn/ui patterns for components (you can mock the installation by creating the raw component files in components/ui).

Coding Principles

Functional Components: Use React functional components with hooks.

Server vs Client: Default to Server Components. Use 'use client' only when interactivity (state, effects) is needed.

Data Fetching: For this MVP, import JSON data directly from src/data/ instead of setting up a fetch API.

Error Handling: Always implement graceful fallbacks if data is missing (e.g., "Price not available" instead of crashing).

Style Guide

Use descriptive variable names (hospitalList instead of list).

Type all props explicitly (e.g., interface HospitalCardProps { ... }).

Do not use any. Use unknown or define a type.
